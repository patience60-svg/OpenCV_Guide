# ðŸŽ¨ Drawing Shapes in OpenCV

This weekâ€™s Vision Tuesdays topic introduces **shape drawing functions in OpenCV**, a fun and visual way to understand how images are represented as matrices of pixels.

### ðŸ§  Key Concepts
- Creating blank images using `np.zeros()`
- Drawing geometric shapes:
  - **Lines** â†’ `cv2.line()`
  - **Circles** â†’ `cv2.circle()`
  - **Rectangles** â†’ `cv2.rectangle()`
- Understanding **coordinates**, **color (BGR)**, and **thickness**

### ðŸ“‚ Included Files
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `code_13.py` | Draw lines using OpenCV |
| `code_14.py` | Draw circles |
| `code_15.py` | Explore coordinates and thickness |
| `code_16.py` | Draw rectangles and squares |

ðŸ’¡ *These basic drawing operations are the foundation for computer vision annotations and visualization tools in AI applications.*
