# ðŸ§© Geometric Transformations

This section explores how to reshape and resize images in OpenCV.

### ðŸ§  Key Concepts
- Resizing images (reduce and enlarge)
- Setting fixed output dimensions
- Understanding interpolation methods:
  - `INTER_AREA` â†’ for reducing image size  
  - `INTER_LINEAR` â†’ for enlarging images  
  - `INTER_CUBIC` â†’ for high-quality resizing  

### ðŸ“‚ Included Files
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `code_11.py` | Resize image (reduce/enlarge) |
| `code_12.py` | Resize with fixed dimensions |

ðŸ’¡ *These transformations are essential for preparing images for AI model training and feature extraction.*
