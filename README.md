# OpenCV_Guide:  OpenCV Image Processing Tutorial

Computer Vision (CV) is a field of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers to understand and interpret visual data from the real world. It powers many applications such as self-driving cars, face recognition, medical imaging, and robotics.

At the core of CV lies image processing â€“ the manipulation and analysis of images to extract useful information. In this repository, we use OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library), a powerful Python library for image processing and computer vision tasks.

This project contains step-by-step beginner-friendly scripts that demonstrate how to:

 1. Load and display an image.

 2. Convert an image to grayscale.

 3. Save processed images.

Each code example builds upon the previous one, making it easier to learn progressively.

### Installation

pip install opencv-python
