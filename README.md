## 🌍 About the Series  

Computer Vision (CV) is a fascinating field of Artificial Intelligence that allows computers to *see* and *understand* the visual world. Using **OpenCV**, one of the most popular CV libraries in Python, this series explores how machines can process images and videos to make intelligent decisions.  

The **Vision Tuesdays** series aims to:  
✅ Teach core computer vision concepts through hands-on coding  
✅ Help beginners build confidence in OpenCV and AI development  
✅ Create open-source learning materials that anyone can use and contribute to
