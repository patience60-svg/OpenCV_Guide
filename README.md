# 🧠 Vision Tuesdays – Learn Computer Vision with OpenCV  

### 🎥 *An Open-Source Series for Beginners in Computer Vision, Image Processing, and AI Development*  

Welcome to **Vision Tuesdays**, an open-source learning series created to help you **build real computer vision projects step-by-step using OpenCV**.  

Every Tuesday, a new topic is added — from simple image operations to advanced AI-powered vision applications — all explained in a clear, beginner-friendly way.

## 🌍 About the Series  

Computer Vision (CV) is a fascinating field of Artificial Intelligence that allows computers to *see* and *understand* the visual world. Using **OpenCV**, one of the most popular CV libraries in Python, this series explores how machines can process images and videos to make intelligent decisions.  

The **Vision Tuesdays** series aims to:  
✅ Teach core computer vision concepts through hands-on coding.  
✅ Help beginners build confidence in OpenCV and AI development.  
✅ Create open-source learning materials that anyone can use and contribute to.
